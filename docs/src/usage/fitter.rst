Fitter
==================================


The :py:class:`~chemfit.fitter.Fitter` class is a wrapper around optimization backends and minimizes objective functions.

Currently it supports the following backends:

1. `Nevergrad <https://github.com/facebookresearch/nevergrad>`_ 
2. `Scipy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html>`_ 

What can be minimized with Fitter
----------------------------------

Any python function with the signature:

.. code-block:: python

    def f(params : dict) -> float:
        # implementation
        ...

Params dict format 
----------------------------------


The ``params`` can be any dictionary, which contains only **float values** or sub-dictionaries, which may in turn contain only float values or sub-dictionaries and so on ...

In other words if the params dict is visualized as a tree (with key-value pairs being branches), all leaf nodes must be float value.

As an example, this is allowed

.. code-block:: python

    # Allowed
    params = {
                "foo" : {
                    "bar" : {
                        "a" : 1.0
                    }
                    "b" : 2.0
                }
            }

This is **not** allowed

.. code-block:: python

    # Not allowed
    params = {
                "foo" : 2.0,
                "bar" : [1.0, 2.0] # <-- Error: "bar" is not a float value
            }

Bounds
----------------------------------


Bounds for parameters (of the form ``lower < param < upper`` ) may be specified, alongside the initial parameters.
They are specified as a dictionary of tuples with the same keys as the ``initial_params``. 
The same rules as for the params dict apply, **except** that each leaf node needs to be a tuple of two floats.


Example:

.. code-block:: python

    bounds = {
                "foo" : {
                    "bar" : {
                        "a" : (0.0, 2.0)
                    }
                    "b" : (-1.0, 3.0) 
                }
            }

.. note::

    It is allowed to **not** specify bounds for a parameter. Simply leave it out of the bounds dictionary.

.. note::

    If a bound is specified, both lower and upper need to be given.

The bounds are passed into the constructor:

.. code-block:: python

    fitter = Fitter(
        objective_function=obj_func,
        initial_params=initial_params,
        bounds=bounds
    )
